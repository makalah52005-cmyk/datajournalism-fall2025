Lede: The reporters uses a human interest lede by starting with the two sick children who were in the hospital. I think this is effective because it hooks the reader emotionally and clearly signals the story's focus on health and pollution.

The Data: The reporters used air sensors, public records, and hospital data to analyze pollution from sugar cane burning. They found short term pollution spikes during burn days and increased hospital visits for breathing problems during the burn season. They also found that the state's main air monitor was flagged as "not fit" for Clean Air Act use. The investigation had some limitations including a short data collection period, a relativley small sample of air sensors, and the fact that the health data showed correlation rather than direct causation. 

Sources: This story's sources consisted of resident tesimonies, experts, and industry responses. The resident testimonies support the data by describing visble ash and health problems. Sugar companies and regulators disputed the findings which created tension throughout the story. Overall, I think the intergration of human sources in the story help the story because it adds emotional impact and credibility.

Story Structure: Vignettes are used by describing personal scenes of residents affected by this crisis. The reporters use inverted prymaid to list key facts about sugar cane burning and pollution. The story also uses the bookend technique to make early and closure connections within the family that is investigated. I think this is effective because it keeps the reader engaged emotionally and through evidence.

Numbers: The data explanations throughout this story are clear and readable with short examples like "spikes lasting less than an hour". Some technical sections like the ones explaining sensor accuracy and humidity adjustments are a bit dense, but still essential for transpanrency and credibility. 

Data Viz: The maps and charts used in this invesigation clearly show air pollution patterns, spikes, and burn areas. I don't think these visualizations felt decorative because they help explain and strengthen the story's findings.

Methods: The repoters clearly acknowledge the study's limitaions such as short time frame, use of low cost sensors, and the difference between correlation and causation. They also published a separate methods response article to ensure transparency about their process. There wasn't a formal nerd box used, but their explanations were detailed and easy to follow. I feel like a simple summary could have made the methodsd even clearer for general readers.

Ect.: I think more granular health data or longer sensor periods could have made this investigation stronger. I thought the Brazil comparison was insighful, but I feel like it could have used more detail.
