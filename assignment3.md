DC Crime Data
1. The intresting question I answered was "which type of crime is most common during each time of day?" This question meets the standards of newsworthiness for AU's audience because it helps students be more alert about when certain crimes are more likely to take place. This gices students and other local residents the ability to take the proper safety precautions during these times. 
2. First I examined the relevant fields of the data set that would be needed to asnwer this question which where the "SHIFT" and "OFFENSE-TEXT" fields. Next, I created a pivot table with "SHIFT" as the rows and "OFFENSE-TEXT" as the columns, I also added "OFFENSE-TEXT" to the values column and made sure it was set to count. Finally, I analyzed the data in the pivot table to find my answer.
3. I found that throughout every time of the day "theft other" is the crime that is most commonly commited.

Final Project Data
1. [Consumer Product Injury Tables.xlsx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/22653943/Consumer.Product.Injury.Tables.xlsx)
2. First I skipped the first four rows because they contained metadata and header information instead of actual data. Next, I loaded the actual data starting from the correct row to focus only on the meaningful product injury records. Then, I renamed the columns to descriptive names that matched the dataset content for clarity and easier analysis. Finally I removed the rows where the "Product Category" column was missing or blank.
3. The intersting question I chose was "which product category causes the most injuries requiring emergency treatment?". This is newsworthy because it relates to public health awareness and provides insights on sports equipment that poses high risk of injury.
4. In my pivot table I put the "Product Category" field into rows. Next, I summed "Estimate Number of Injuries" field to aggregate injuries by product group. Last, I sorted the pivot table descending by injury count to find the highest risk product.
5. Using the pivot table I found toys caused most injuries in 2013

Story Research
From what I've researched so far early injuries in youth sports are often tied to overuse and overtraining, causing young atheletes to develop stress fractures, tendonitis, and joint damage similar to what professional althetes face but at much younger ages. Something that hasn't been fully adressed that I want to tackle is figuring out the details of which sports are most at risk, how factors like club vs. school programs and parental or coaching pressures shape training loads, and the longterm consequences such as burnout, dropout, and mental health impacts. I also plan to explore preventative measures, including workload limits, cross training, and education for families and coaches.
